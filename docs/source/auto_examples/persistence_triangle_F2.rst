Example script: persistent homology over a finite field on a small filtered complex.

This file demonstrates :func:`homolipop.persistence.persistent_homology_field`
on the simplicial complex generated by a single triangle.

The filtration used here is the order of the list ``simplices`` returned by
:func:`homolipop.simplices.build_complex`. This order is assumed to be compatible
with the face relation, meaning every face appears no later than the simplex itself.

Mathematical conventions
========================

Filtered simplicial complex
---------------------------

Let :math:`K` be an abstract simplicial complex on a finite vertex set.
A filtration of :math:`K` is a nested sequence of subcomplexes

.. math::

   \emptyset = K_{-1} \subseteq K_0 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq K_{m-1} = K,

such that each step adds exactly one simplex.
Equivalently, a filtration is given by an ordering of the simplices

.. math::

   \sigma_0,\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_{m-1},

with the admissibility condition

.. math::

   \tau \subseteq \sigma_j \implies \tau = \sigma_i \text{ for some } i \le j.

In this file, the filtration order is the order of the list ``simplices``.

Coefficients
------------

Fix a prime :math:`p` and let :math:`\mathbb F_p` be the finite field of order :math:`p`.
All homology groups below are taken with coefficients in :math:`\mathbb F_p`.

Persistent homology in this setting
-----------------------------------

Let :math:`K_i` denote the subcomplex generated by :math:`\{\sigma_0,\dots,\sigma_i\}`.
For each dimension :math:`k \ge 0`, we obtain a persistence module

.. math::

   H_k(K_0;\mathbb F_p)
   \to
   H_k(K_1;\mathbb F_p)
   \to \cdots \to
   H_k(K_{m-1};\mathbb F_p),

induced by inclusions :math:`K_i \hookrightarrow K_j`.

Pairing output format
---------------------

The algorithm implemented by :func:`homolipop.persistence.persistent_homology_field`
is assumed to compute the standard simplex pairing produced by matrix reduction.

- A *paired* class is reported as a triple ``(birth, death, dim)``, meaning that a
  homology class in dimension ``dim`` is born when simplex ``simplices[birth]`` is added
  and dies when simplex ``simplices[death]`` is added.

- An *unpaired* class is reported as a pair ``(birth, dim)``, meaning that the class born
  at index ``birth`` in dimension ``dim`` persists to the end of the filtration.

In this file the complex is a single filled triangle, so there is one connected component
born at the first vertex that remains unpaired, and the 1-cycle created by the last edge
dies when the 2-simplex is added.

Implementation contract
-----------------------

This file assumes the following.

- The input ``simplices`` is a list of simplices represented as strictly increasing tuples.
- The list order is a filtration order satisfying the admissibility condition above.
- ``field_Fp(p)`` constructs a field descriptor implementing arithmetic in :math:`\mathbb F_p`.
- The return value ``result`` has attributes ``pairs`` and ``unpaired`` as described above.
