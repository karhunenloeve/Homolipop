        "\nExample script: persistent homology over $\\mathbb F_5$ on a single filtered triangle.\n\nThis file is identical in structure to the $\\mathbb F_2$ example, but uses the field\n$\\mathbb F_5$ as coefficients.\n\nFor the specific filtered complex used here, the pairing produced by standard persistence\nreduction does not depend on the choice of field, because the boundary coefficients are\nonly $0$ and $\\pm 1$, and $\\pm 1$ are units in every field.\n\n# Mathematical conventions\n\n## Filtered simplicial complex\n\nLet $K$ be the abstract simplicial complex generated by the 2-simplex\n$(0,1,2)$. Let\n\n\\begin{align}\\sigma_0,\\sigma_1,\\dots,\\sigma_{m-1}\\end{align}\n\nbe the list ``simplices`` returned by :func:`homolipop.simplices.build_complex`.\nThis order is assumed to be a filtration order, meaning every face appears no later\nthan the simplex itself.\n\nDefine\n\n\\begin{align}K_i = \\langle \\sigma_0,\\dots,\\sigma_i \\rangle\\end{align}\n\nto be the subcomplex generated by the first $i+1$ simplices in the list.\n\n## Coefficients\n\nFix the prime $p=5$. All homology groups are computed with coefficients in the field\n\n\\begin{align}\\mathbb F_5 = \\mathbb Z/5\\mathbb Z.\\end{align}\n\n## Persistent pairing format\n\nThe routine :func:`homolipop.persistence.persistent_homology_field` is assumed to return\n\n- ``pairs`` as triples ``(birth, death, dim)``\n- ``unpaired`` as pairs ``(birth, dim)``\n\nwith the meaning that a class in dimension ``dim`` is born when simplex ``birth`` enters\nand dies when simplex ``death`` enters, or persists forever if unpaired.\n\n## Expected qualitative outcome\n\nFor a filled triangle, the persistence behaviour is as follows.\n\n- One connected component in dimension 0 is born at the first vertex and remains unpaired.\n- A 1-cycle is created when the last edge closing the triangle boundary appears and dies\n  when the 2-simplex appears.\n\nThe exact integer indices depend on the simplex ordering returned by :func:`build_complex`.\n\n## Implementation contract\n\nThis script assumes that :func:`field_Fp(5)` constructs a coefficient field descriptor\nfor arithmetic in $\\mathbb F_5$.\n"
