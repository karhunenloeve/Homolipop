        "\nExample script: persistent homology over a finite field on a small filtered complex.\n\nThis file demonstrates :func:`homolipop.persistence.persistent_homology_field`\non the simplicial complex generated by a single triangle.\n\nThe filtration used here is the order of the list ``simplices`` returned by\n:func:`homolipop.simplices.build_complex`. This order is assumed to be compatible\nwith the face relation, meaning every face appears no later than the simplex itself.\n\n# Mathematical conventions\n\n## Filtered simplicial complex\n\nLet $K$ be an abstract simplicial complex on a finite vertex set.\nA filtration of $K$ is a nested sequence of subcomplexes\n\n\\begin{align}\\emptyset = K_{-1} \\subseteq K_0 \\subseteq \\cdots \\subseteq K_{m-1} = K,\\end{align}\n\nsuch that each step adds exactly one simplex.\nEquivalently, a filtration is given by an ordering of the simplices\n\n\\begin{align}\\sigma_0,\\sigma_1,\\dots,\\sigma_{m-1},\\end{align}\n\nwith the admissibility condition\n\n\\begin{align}\\tau \\subseteq \\sigma_j \\implies \\tau = \\sigma_i \\text{ for some } i \\le j.\\end{align}\n\nIn this file, the filtration order is the order of the list ``simplices``.\n\n## Coefficients\n\nFix a prime $p$ and let $\\mathbb F_p$ be the finite field of order $p$.\nAll homology groups below are taken with coefficients in $\\mathbb F_p$.\n\n## Persistent homology in this setting\n\nLet $K_i$ denote the subcomplex generated by $\\{\\sigma_0,\\dots,\\sigma_i\\}$.\nFor each dimension $k \\ge 0$, we obtain a persistence module\n\n\\begin{align}H_k(K_0;\\mathbb F_p)\n   \\to\n   H_k(K_1;\\mathbb F_p)\n   \\to \\cdots \\to\n   H_k(K_{m-1};\\mathbb F_p),\\end{align}\n\ninduced by inclusions $K_i \\hookrightarrow K_j$.\n\n## Pairing output format\n\nThe algorithm implemented by :func:`homolipop.persistence.persistent_homology_field`\nis assumed to compute the standard simplex pairing produced by matrix reduction.\n\n- A *paired* class is reported as a triple ``(birth, death, dim)``, meaning that a\n  homology class in dimension ``dim`` is born when simplex ``simplices[birth]`` is added\n  and dies when simplex ``simplices[death]`` is added.\n\n- An *unpaired* class is reported as a pair ``(birth, dim)``, meaning that the class born\n  at index ``birth`` in dimension ``dim`` persists to the end of the filtration.\n\nIn this file the complex is a single filled triangle, so there is one connected component\nborn at the first vertex that remains unpaired, and the 1-cycle created by the last edge\ndies when the 2-simplex is added.\n\n## Implementation contract\n\nThis file assumes the following.\n\n- The input ``simplices`` is a list of simplices represented as strictly increasing tuples.\n- The list order is a filtration order satisfying the admissibility condition above.\n- ``field_Fp(p)`` constructs a field descriptor implementing arithmetic in $\\mathbb F_p$.\n- The return value ``result`` has attributes ``pairs`` and ``unpaired`` as described above.\n"
