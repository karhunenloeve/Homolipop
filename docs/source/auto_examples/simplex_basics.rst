Simplex utilities: canonicalization, dimension, and face iteration.

This example demonstrates three basic utilities from :mod:`homolipop.simplices`.

- :func:`homolipop.simplices.canonical_simplex` for canonicalizing a vertex tuple
- :func:`homolipop.simplices.simplex_dim` for computing the simplex dimension
- :func:`homolipop.simplices.iter_faces` for enumerating faces of a given dimension

Mathematical conventions
========================

Canonical simplex representation
--------------------------------

A simplex is represented by a tuple of vertex indices.

Given an arbitrary finite tuple of integers

.. math::

   v = (v_0,\dots,v_m),

we interpret it as specifying a set of vertices.
The canonical simplex associated to :math:`v` is the strictly increasing tuple obtained by

1. removing duplicate entries
2. sorting the remaining vertices in increasing order

Equivalently, if :math:`S = \{v_0,\dots,v_m\}` is the set of values appearing in :math:`v`,
then

.. math::

   \mathrm{canonical\_simplex}(v) = (w_0,\dots,w_k),

where :math:`w_0 < \cdots < w_k` are the elements of :math:`S` in increasing order.

Dimension
---------

If :math:`\sigma = (w_0,\dots,w_k)` is a canonical simplex with :math:`k+1` vertices,
its dimension is

.. math::

   \dim(\sigma) = k.

Face enumeration
----------------

Let :math:`\sigma` be a simplex with vertex set :math:`V(\sigma)`.
For :math:`r \in \{0,\dots,\dim(\sigma)\}`, an :math:`r` face of :math:`\sigma`
is a simplex obtained by choosing :math:`r+1` vertices from :math:`V(\sigma)`.

The generator :func:`homolipop.simplices.iter_faces` is assumed to yield all faces of
a prescribed dimension ``face_dim`` as canonical tuples, in a deterministic order.

In this example, the canonicalization step maps ``raw = (5, 2, 7, 2)`` to the simplex
``(2, 5, 7)``, which is a 2-simplex. The printed messages refer to a 3-simplex only if
the input has four distinct vertices. With the given input, the simplex is a triangle,
so its 2-faces are itself and it has no 3-dimensional structure.

To avoid confusion, this script prints faces relative to the actual computed dimension.
